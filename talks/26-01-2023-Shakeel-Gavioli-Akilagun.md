# On weak convergence of dyadic scans

Consider an independent sequence of standard Gaussians X1, X2, ..., Xn. To test for an unknown region on which the mean is elevated one could take all contiguous subsets of {1,2,...,n} and compute the appropriate likelihood ration statistic for X's falling in this set. Since the location of the elevated mean is unknown one would take the maximum of all such statistics. In practice, to reduce the number of computations, it is convenient to restrict to subsets of dyadic length. Both statistics are common in change point analysis. 

In this situation something strange happens: the "complete scan" can be centred and scaled so that it converges weakly to an extreme value distribution but the "dyadic scan" cannot. Instead the maximum fluctuates, similar to what is observed when taking the maximum of a sequence of i.i.d. Geometric random variables. I will give a proof-sketch of this bizarre result. Along the way I will review some powerful tool for the analysis of Gaussian fields which are potentially useful for other research questions.
