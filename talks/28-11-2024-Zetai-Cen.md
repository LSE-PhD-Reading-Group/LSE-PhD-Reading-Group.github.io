# Testing main-effect matrix factor models from two-way matrix factor models

In this talk, a brief introduction on matrix factor models will be given, followed by a discussion on main-effect matrix factor models. We will show that testing such main-effect factor models is non-trivial, ending up with one feasible test introduced.
