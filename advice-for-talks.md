# Some suggestions on giving a talk

Your talk should be around 60 minutes long, with some time left over questions. The convention is for whiteboard talks, with slides etc. reserved for presenting tables and figures. Don't feel you have to present "polished" results, the whole point of the reading group is to talk about interesting open questions and ongoing work! If you are looking for some inspiration, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE8NIszVkKE) for an example of a whiteboard talk delivered over zoom on, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCXXgGNpmIY) for an example of one delivered in person. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT_-owjKIbA&t=364s) for a talk on how to give a talk. Also, here are some dos and don'ts more specific to our reading group:

✨ Make your talk interactive

✨ Use whiteboard as much as possible to  

✨ Feel free to present "incomplete" results or even just interesting proof strategies


❌ Try not to use slides, unless you are presenting plots or tables

❌ Don't assume too much of your audience (throughout your talk you will be the most knowledgeable person in the room)

❌ Don't spend too much time on small technical details
